# AstroidEscape
AstroidEscape is an exciting arcade-style game built using Pygame where players control a spaceship, dodging asteroids of varying speeds and sizes. The game dynamically generates asteroids using data from NASA's NEO (Near-Earth Object) API to create a more realistic and ever-changing environment.
