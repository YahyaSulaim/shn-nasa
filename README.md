# AstroidEscape
AstroidEscape is an exciting arcade-style game built using Pygame where players control a spaceship, dodging asteroids of varying speeds and sizes. The game dynamically generates asteroids using data from NASA's NEO (Near-Earth Object) API to create a more realistic and ever-changing environment.

## How It Works?
1. The player controls a spaceship and must dodge oncoming asteroids.
2. The game pulls asteroid data from NASA's NEO API, which provides real-time data about asteroids' speeds and sizes.
3. Each asteroid is generated based on this data, creating a diverse range of challenges for the player.
4. The playerâ€™s goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding asteroids.

### Gameplay Demo
- Embed a video here of the game in action, showing how the spaceship moves and how the asteroids are generated.
